    "we must be able to create and work with a binary search tree that is empty, our implementation\n",

    "The BinarySearchTree class has a reference to the TreeNode that\n",
    "is the root of the binary search tree. In most cases the external methods defined in the outer\n",
    "class simply check to see if the tree is empty. If there are nodes in the tree, the request is just\n",
    "passed on to a private method defined in the BinarySearchTree class that takes the root as\n",
    "a parameter. In the case where the tree is empty or we want to delete the key at the root of\n",
    "the tree, we must take special action. The code for the BinarySearchTree class constructor\n",
