    "## Simulation: Printing Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "A more interesting simulation allows us to study the behavior of the printing queue described\n",
    "earlier in this section. Recall that as students send printing tasks to the shared printer, the tasks\n",
    "are placed in a queue to be processed in a first-come first-served manner. Many questions arise\n",
    "with this configuration. The most important of these might be whether the printer is capable of\n",
    "handling a certain amount of work. If it cannot, students will be waiting too long for printing\n",
    "and may miss their next class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following situation in a computer science laboratory. On any average day about\n",
    "10 students are working in the lab at any given hour. These students typically print up to twice\n",
    "during that time, and the length of these tasks ranges from 1 to 20 pages. The printer in the\n",
    "lab is older, capable of processing 10 pages per minute of draft quality. The printer could be\n",
    "switched to give better quality, but then it would produce only five pages per minute. The\n",
    "slower printing speed could make students wait too long. What page rate should be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could decide by building a simulation that models the laboratory. We will need to construct\n",
    "representations for students, printing tasks, and the printer. As students submit\n",
    "printing tasks, we will add them to a waiting list, a queue of print tasks attached to the printer.\n",
    "When the printer completes a task, it will look at the queue to see if there are any remaining\n",
    "tasks to process. Of interest for us is the average amount of time students will wait for their\n",
    "papers to be printed. This is equal to the average amount of time a task waits in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this situation we need to use some probabilities. For example, students may print\n",
    "a paper from 1 to 20 pages in length. If each length from 1 to 20 is equally likely, the actual\n",
    "length for a print task can be simulated by using a random number between 1 and 20 inclusive.\n",
    "This means that there is equal chance of any length from 1 to 20 appearing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are 10 students in the lab and each prints twice, then there are 20 print tasks per hour\n",
    "on average. What is the chance that at any given second, a print task is going to be created?\n",
    "The way to answer this is to consider the ratio of tasks to time. Twenty tasks per hour means\n",
    "that on average there will be one task every 180 seconds:\n",
    "\n",
    "For every second we can simulate the chance that a print task occurs by generating a random\n",
    "number between 1 and 180 inclusive. If the number is 180, we say a task has been created.\n",
    "Note that it is possible that many tasks could be created in a row or we may wait quite a while\n",

    "### Main Simulation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the main simulation.\n",
    "1. Create a queue of print tasks. Each task will be given a timestamp upon its arrival. The\n",
    "queue is empty to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each second (current_second):\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Does a new print task get created? If so, add it to the queue with the current_second\n",
    "as the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "    • If the printer is not busy and if a task is waiting,\n",
    "\n",
    "    – Remove the next task (as in the task at the front from where the queue gets dequeued normally) from the print queue and assign it to the printer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    – Subtract the timestamp from the current_second to compute the waiting time\n",
    "for that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    – Append the waiting time for that task to a list for later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    – Based on the number of pages in the print task, figure out how much time will\n",
    "be required (the printer will come up with an estimated time in seconds probably).\n",
    "\n",
    "    • The printer now does one second of printing if necessary. It also subtracts one\n",
    "second from the time required for that task (its referring to the estimate).\n",
    "\n",
    "    • If the task has been completed, in other words the time required has reached zero,\n",
    "the printer is no longer busy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After the simulation is complete, compute the average waiting time from the list of waiting times generated.\n",

    "The Printer class will need to track whether it has a current task. If it does, then it is busy\n",
    "and the amount of time needed can be computed from the number of pages in the task. The\n",
    "constructor will also allow the pages-per-minute setting to be initialized. The tick method\n",
