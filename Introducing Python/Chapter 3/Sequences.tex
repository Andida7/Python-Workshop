\frametitle{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item To understand built-in data sequence types such as Lists, Sets, Tuples and Dictionaries.
\item To understand their applications and advantages.
\item To understand iterators and constructs that support sequences.
\item To learn the different operations that could be performed on these types.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Lists}
\begin{itemize}
\item A list is a collection of data elements arranged sequentially.
\item They are mutable in nature, in that they can be appended to, and data removed from.
\item Lists are enclosed by a pair of squared brackets '[]'
\item Lists in Python are heterogeneous. A list can contain any different type of data.
\item Lists are especially good for keeping track of things that could change in the course of the program execution.
\item A list could be created by a pair of squared-brackets [] or list().
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Creating a List}
A list could be created as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
cities = ['Chicago','San Francisco','New York']
# A list could also become an 
# element of another list 
metros = ['Dallas','Las Vegas', cities]
print(cities)
['Chicago', 'San Francisco', 'New York']
print(metros)
['Dallas', 'Las Vegas', ['Chicago', 
'San Francisco', 'New York']]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Changing the cities list here modifies the  metros list as well.
\item This is because, cities is just a reference to the block of memory containing "cities list" and changes to it is being reflected in the metros list.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Data Type Conversions in Lists}
Converting a string to a list is easy as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
language = list('Python')
print(language)
['P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']

# Converting String to List using split()
birthday = '8/11/2017'
dob = birthday.split('/')
print(dob)
['8', '11', '2017']

# List can be converted to a String using join() as follows:
statement = ['I','love','Python']
sentence = ' '.join(statement)
print(sentence)
'I love Python'
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Common List Operations}
The following are the common operations in List.
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding elements to the list using add, append and insert.
\item Indexing and Slicing for data retrieval.
\item Modifying the list using indexing and Slicing techniques.
\item Concatenating Lists.
\item Removing items from the list using "del" remove and pop.
\item Determining the membership of an item and counting the number of items.
\item Searching and Sorting the list.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Tuples}
Similar to lists, tuples are sequences of arbitrary items. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Tuples are the immutable collection sequence types in Python.
\item Tuples canâ€™t be modified using add, delete, or changing of items once the tuple is created. A tuple is thus a constant list type.
\item A tuple can be created using a pair of parenthesis ().
\item Notice that it is different from how a list can be created by saying "list()".
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Tuple Unpacking}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple variables can be assigned with values at one go using Tuples in Python.
\item This underlying implementation has a bigger advantage in Python in a few  operations such as swapping two/more variables.
\item In other programming languages, particularly statically-typed language, it is more complicated than how it's done in Python.
\item Without the use of a temporary variable, unlike in other languages, in Python, two variables can be swapped as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
a,b = b,a
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item We understood what sequences are in Python.
\item We extensively experimented with Python's sequential data types such as Lists and Tuples.
\item We learned the difference between these two sequence types and how they help us in different situations.
\item We understood and worked with the different methods that these two structures provide.
\end{itemize}
