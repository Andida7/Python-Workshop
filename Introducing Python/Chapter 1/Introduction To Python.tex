\frametitle{Session Plan}
The following topics will be discussed in this four days.
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction to Python's Data Types.
\item Object Oriented Programming in Python.
\item File and Data I/O.
\item Scientific Computing using Numpy. 
\item Pandas for Data Analysis.
\item Data Visualization using Matlplotlib.
\item Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms.
\item Building Abstract Data Structures using Python.
\item Searching and Sorting Algorithms.
\item Creating Tree Data Structures using Python.
\item Where to go from here. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Introduction To Python}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python is a general-purpose, open-source, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted language.
\item It has a very easy to understand Syntax and easy prototyping ability.
\item It has a gentle learning curve that helps a  programmer productive at a very early stage.
\item It is relatively terse compared to other languages and requires comparatively  a few lines of code that could take more number of lines of code in other languages to solve a problem.
\item Python is currently being used in various areas of computer science such as Web Development, Machine Learning, Neural Networks and also in Quantum Computing.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Comparison To Other Languages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python is generally slower compared to C, C++ for computationally intensive applications.
\item Where it lacks in speed relatively, it gains in speed of development which helps a programmer experiment more.
\item The Standard Python Interpreter is implemented in C and this implementation is called "CPython".
\item Python interpreters are becoming faster and newer implementations such as "PyPy" are faster than the CPython implementation.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Python 2 Versus Python 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python 2 has been around for so long and comes as part of Linux and Apple machines.
\item Python 3 is an improvement over Python 2, that has overcome many drawbacks of the language and is currently being widely adopted.
\item The last version of Python 2, 2.7 is still supported and will be in general usage. But it is the last of the series.
\item Some of the most prominent changes see in Python 3 is the print statement, string formatting and use of the Unicode Standard for text data.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Let's Write Our First Python Program}
Now that we have learned what Python is about, let's go ahead and write our first Python program.

\begin{itemize}
\item Open a file in your machine using either using notepad or a text editor of your choice.
\item Type "print("Hello World!!")" and save the file.
\item Name the file as \textit{first\_program.py} and save it.
\item Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the path where the \textit{.py} file has been saved.
\item Type the following command:

python file\_name.py and hit enter and wait for the magic to happen.
\item We have performed the first ritual of saying "Hello World!!" to our fellow programmers.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Hope you enjoyed the Introduction. There is more to come and we hope you all enjoy 4 days of learning with us.


Thank you.
